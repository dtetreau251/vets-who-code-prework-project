                        <h1>About me</h1>
                        <p>Hi! My name is David Tetreau. I would like to introduce myself, and share a little about myself. 
                            My career began in the Alabama National Guard in 2000 when I was 17.  I was a Military Policeman and continued
                            that role by joining the United States Army in 2002. I served in several combat areas including Djibouti, Kuwait, Iraq, and 
                            Afghanistan. When I left the Army, I started a career in law enforcement. I have been a Deputy Sheriff for 14 years and 
                            have had many rewarding experiences. As part of that role, I teach school children lessons on topic such as drug prevention. 
                            I love teaching! I am also a lifelong learner. That is why I have started learning web development. I have completed some basic lessons 
                            from several internet sources including freecodecamp, Codecademy, Khan Academy, Youtube, LinkedIn, V-School and more. I also obtained an 
                            Undergraduate Certificate in Software Development from University of Phoenix. I am currently seeking enrollment in the VetsWhoCode 
                            program. I feel like being around aspiring Web Developers who share similar life experiences as me is exactly what I need!
